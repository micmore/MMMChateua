- **CSS**: Used for styling, ensuring the website is visually appealing and aligns with modern design trends.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances interactivity and user experience across the site.
- **PHP**: Though not explicitly mentioned in the HTML snippet, if PHP is utilized, it's typically for server-side logic or data processing.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures the website is responsive and mobile-friendly, adapting to various screen sizes and devices seamlessly.

## Responsive Design

The website employs responsive design principles, adapting its layout and content to provide an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices.
